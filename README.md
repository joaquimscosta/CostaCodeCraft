# CostaCodeCraft

Welcome to my digital home! This website serves as both my professional portfolio and a knowledge-sharing hub, focusing on my journey and insights as a backend software engineer.

## About the Project

This website is built using React. The codebase leverages Create React App for streamlined development and deployment.

## Features

* **Showcase of Backend Expertise:** Explore my projects and experience in backend development.
* **Knowledge Sharing:** Find articles and insights related to backend technologies and best practices.
* **Contact Information:** Easily connect with me for potential collaboration or just to say hello!

## Getting Started

If you'd like to run this project locally, here's how:

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone [repository URL]`
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3. **Run the development server:** `npm start`
   * This opens the website in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Available Scripts
